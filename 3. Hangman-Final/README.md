**Introduction:**
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word letter by letter. The player starts with six lives, and they lose a life for each incorrect guess. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

**How to Play:**
1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. The game will display the Hangman logo and select a random word as the secret word.
3. The length of the word will be represented by underscores (_).
4. Enter a letter as a guess for the word.
5. If the guessed letter has been guessed before, you will be notified.
6. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
7. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life.
8. The game ends if you correctly guess the entire word or run out of lives.
9. If you lose, the secret word is revealed.
10. If you win, you will be congratulated.

**Requirements:**
1. Python 3.8
2. The game uses 'hangman_words.py,' containing a list of words, and 'hangman_art.py,' containing ASCII art for the Hangman figure.
